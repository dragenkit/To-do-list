<h3>How to use</h3>
Write your todos in the text field and add it to the todo list.<br>
Click on your todos to mark them as completed

<h3>For the future</h3>
I am currently looking into connecting a database<br>
to save the todos even after closing the program.
<br>
<br>
I also wish to improve the style and GUI of my program.
